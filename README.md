# Tic-Tac-Toe-App


We all have played Tic-tac-toe, Noughts, and Crosses, or Xs and Os and enjoyed playing it too.

So here's an implementation of the game in Flutter


### Implementation

In the game, when a player wins, loses, or draws a game against another player then a dialog box is displayed on the screen showing the result.

At the end of a game, if a player wishes to reset the game, they may do so by pressing the reset button at the bottom of the application screen
