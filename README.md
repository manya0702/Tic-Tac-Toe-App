# Tic-Tac-Toe-App

We all have played Tic-tac-toe, Noughts, and Crosses, or Xs and Os and enjoyed playing it too.

So here's is an implementation of the game using Flutter


### Implementation

Whenever a player wins, loses or draws a game with another player, a dialog box displaying the result of the game pops on the screen. After finishing a game, a player may even use the reset button present at the bottom of the application to reset the entire game.
